# Cross-lingual Alzheimer's Detection

This repository accompanies our paper on **Cross-lingual Alzheimer's Detection**, presenting methods and experiments for detecting Alzheimer's Disease across speakers of different languages using machine learning and natural language processing techniques.

## Overview

Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurological disorder affecting millions worldwide. Early and accurate detection is crucial for intervention and care. However, most existing automated detection models rely heavily on language-specific datasets, limiting their applicability globally.

Our work addresses this gap by developing and evaluating a cross-lingual approach for Alzheimer's detection, traning in English and testing in a Latinoamerican Spanish cohort. We showcase methods that leverage both linguistic and acoustic features to build models that generalize across languages.
